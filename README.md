# Elm Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game for a single player (with a random choice opponent) or two players at the same computer.

# Why??
I got into it and was having a lot of fun figuring out the algorithm for determining if the player had won or not.
I also really enjoyed feeling more fluent with Elm/FP things like: code/module organization, function composition, data
types and dependencies.
